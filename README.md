# Hi, I’m Sayyod (Mirzamitdinov) 👋

I’m a **full-stack software engineer** with **~5 years of frontend experience**
and strong hands-on work across **backend, mobile, and cloud infrastructure**.

I specialize in building **production-ready systems** — not prototypes —
with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

## 💼 Core Experience

### Frontend (Primary Strength)

- **~5 years of experience**
- **Next.js** (App Router, Server Actions, SSR/SSG)
- **React**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- Component-driven UI, performance optimization, accessibility
- Building large, real-world dashboards and consumer apps

### Mobile Development

- **Flutter** — ~2 years
- **React Native** — 1+ year
- Production apps, not tutorials
- State management, API integration, performance considerations

## 🧠 Full-Stack & Backend Work

In recent projects, I’ve worked extensively on the backend side:

- Full-stack applications using **Prisma**
- Designing relational schemas and data flows
- API design and business logic
- Background workers and async processing
- File processing pipelines and integrations

## ☁️ Cloud, Data & Infrastructure

I actively work with modern cloud platforms and production data systems:

### Cloud

- **Google Cloud Platform**
  - Cloud services
  - Background workers
- **AWS**
  - S3 buckets (uploads, processing, storage)

### Data

- **PostgreSQL** (Neon)
- **Firestore**
- Schema design, migrations, performance awareness

### Storage & Processing

- Workers that process data from:
  - Google Cloud
  - AWS S3
- Scalable file and data workflows

## 🧩 How I Work

I care deeply about:

- clear system boundaries
- boring but reliable solutions
- reducing complexity instead of adding abstractions
- building systems that remain understandable after months

I prefer **structure over motivation** and **consistency over intensity**.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

> Strong systems beat short-term effort.

This applies both to software and to personal growth.
I build things to last — technically and mentally.

Thanks for stopping by.
