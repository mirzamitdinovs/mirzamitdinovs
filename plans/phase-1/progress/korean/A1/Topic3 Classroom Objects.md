# 📘 Topic 3: Classroom Objects & Demonstratives (이, 그, 저)

## 📌 Overview

- Learn how to name classroom objects.
- Use demonstratives to say "this," "that," and "that over there."

## 📘 Explanation

Korean uses three main demonstratives:

| Korean | Usage             | English Meaning |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 이     | Near the speaker  | This            |
| 그     | Near the listener | That            |
| 저     | Far from both     | That over there |

These words combine with **것 (thing)**:

| ---------- | --------------------- |
| 이것       | This thing            |
| 그것       | That thing            |
| 저것       | That thing over there |

### 📘 Sentence Patterns
