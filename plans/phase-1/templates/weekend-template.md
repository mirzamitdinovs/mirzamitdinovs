# Phase 1 — Weekend Execution Template

**Purpose:** Absorb overflow, reduce weekday pressure, reset mentally  
**Rule:** Weekends support weekdays — they do not compete with them

This template applies to **Saturday & Sunday** in Phase 1.

---

## 🌅 Morning — Same Foundation as Weekdays

- Wake up naturally (early preferred, no alarm stress)
- Fajr prayer
- Qur’an recitation
- Short reading

> Morning foundation stays the same.  
> This keeps identity stable across the week.

---

## 🧠 Morning Block — Flexible Deep Work

### 💻 DSA (from `phase-1-dsa.md`)

- Work on **current weekly topic only**
- Longer, calmer session than weekdays
- Focus on:
  - Understanding
  - Re-solving failed problems
  - Explaining solutions out loud

**Duration:** 2–3 hours (with breaks)

**Rule:**  
No new topics. Depth > breadth.

---

### 🇰🇷 Korean (from `phase-1-korean.md`)

- Longer exposure than weekdays
- Options:
  - Re-watch grammar explanations
  - Read short texts
  - Light speaking (alone)

**Duration:** 45–90 minutes

---

## 🚀 Midday / Afternoon — Megatour (Primary Slot)

- All Megatour work should live **here**
- Clear task list before starting
- Hard stop when tasks are done

**Duration:** 4–6 hours total per weekend  
(can be split across Sat/Sun)

**Rules:**

- No scope expansion
- No perfectionism
- If tired → stop early

---

## 🏋️ Physical Activity

### Saturday

- Gym session (normal maintenance)
- No PRs, no overtraining

### Sunday

- Optional:
  - Walk
  - Stretch
  - Light movement

---

## 🌙 Sunday Evening — Reset Ritual (Important)

- No heavy thinking
- No planning new goals
- Light reflection only
- Prepare for Monday

> A calm Sunday evening protects the entire next week.

---

## 🚨 Weekend Safety Rules

1. Weekends are **not catch-up punishment**
2. If weekday was heavy → weekend is lighter
3. Megatour never steals sleep
4. If energy is low → Qur’an + rest is enough

---

A weekend is successful if:

- [ ] Qur’an consistency is maintained
