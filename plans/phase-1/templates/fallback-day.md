# Phase 1 — Fallback Day Protocol

**Purpose:** Prevent burnout and guilt on low-energy days

Use this when:

- Sleep was bad
- Work exploded
- Mental energy is low
- You feel resistance

---

## ✅ Minimum Viable Day

If today is a fallback day, only do the following:

- [ ] Sleep properly
- [ ] Qur’an (any amount)
- [ ] Korean (10–15 min)
- [ ] Main job responsibilities

That’s it.

---

## 🚫 Explicitly Skip

- DSA
- Megatour
- Planning
- Catch-up behavior

Skipping is **intentional**, not failure.

---

## 🧠 Rule

One fallback day is normal.  
Two fallback days in a row → reduce weekly load.

Protect consistency, not streaks.
