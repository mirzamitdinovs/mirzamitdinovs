## 🌅 Morning — Foundation (Non-Negotiable)

### ⏰ Wake up

- Wake up early (target: ~05:00)
- Eat / hydrate
- Fajr prayer

### 🕌 Qur’an

- Daily recitation (any amount counts)
- Goal: consistency, not speed

### 📖 Reading

- Short book reading (10–15 min)
- No pressure to finish chapters

**Rule:**  
Do not choose topics. Follow the checklist only.

---

### 💻 DSA (from `phase-1-dsa.md`)

Duration: **~6 hours (compressed focus)**

---

## 🏋️ Evening — Physical & Mental Shutdown

### Gym (Tue / Thu / Sat only)

- Strength maintenance

---

## 🌙 Night — Close the Day

- Dinner
- Light wind-down
- Minimal screens

### 😴 Sleep

---

## 🚨 Fallback Rules (Bad Day Protocol)

If the day starts breaking:

1. Keep **sleep**
2. Keep **Qur’an**
3. Keep **main job**
4. Keep **Korean**
5. Reduce or skip **DSA**
6. Skip everything else without guilt

One bad day does **not** break the plan.
Two bad days = adjust workload.

---

## ✅ End of Day Check (2 minutes)

- [ ] Qur’an done
- [ ] Korean topic touched
- [ ] DSA topic touched
- [ ] Job done
- [ ] Slept early

If **3 out of 5** are checked → the day is a success.

## 🧠 Reminder

You are not here to optimize.
You are here to **finish Phase 1 cleanly**.

Boring days win.
