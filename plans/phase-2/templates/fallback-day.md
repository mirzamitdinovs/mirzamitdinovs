# Phase 2 — Fallback Day Template

## 🌅 Morning — Non-Negotiable Core

**04:30 – 06:15**

- Wake up
- Hygiene
- Fajr prayer
- Qur’an recitation
- Light breakfast

This block is never skipped.
If this is done, the day is already valid.

## 🧠 Cognitive Work — Minimal Viable Effort

**Max 60 minutes total**

Choose **one only**:

- Light DSA review (re-read old solution)
- Light system design outline (no deep thinking)
- Korean listening / speaking (low pressure)

No problem solving.
No timers.
Stop early if tired.

## 💼 Work

**12:30 – 20:30**

- No extra optimization
- No studying during work hours

Work completion > productivity perfection.
