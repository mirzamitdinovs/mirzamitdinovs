# Phase 2 — Weekday Execution Template (With Gym)

**Wake-up:** 04:30  
**Theme:** High cognitive output before work, physical training during buffer, calm evenings  
**This template is used on gym days (Tue / Thu / Sat).**

## 🌅 Morning — Spiritual & Identity Anchor

**04:30 – 06:15**

- Wake up, hygiene
- Fajr prayer
- Qur’an recitation
- Light breakfast

This block exists to anchor the day spiritually and mentally.
It is intentionally placed before any cognitive or professional work.

The rule is simple:
If this block is completed, the day is not considered a failure — regardless of what follows.

---

## 🧠 Deep Work Block — Analytical Peak

**06:15 – 09:00**

### 💻 DSA (from `checklists/dsa.md`)

- Work only on the **current weekly topic**
- Medium problems only
- Think → explain → code
- Stop after 1–2 problems

This block uses the highest-quality cognitive hours of the day.
No language learning, no system design, no multitasking is allowed here.

The goal is **clarity and pattern recognition**, not volume.

---

## ☕ Cognitive Reset

**09:00 – 09:30**

- Walk or stretch
- No screens
- No information intake

This break exists to deliberately reset attention before switching problem domains.
Skipping this break degrades the quality of system design work that follows.

---

## 🧠 Structured Reasoning — System Design

**09:30 – 10:30**

### 🧠 System Design (from `checklists/system-design.md`)

- One concept OR one system outline
- Follow the interview structure strictly
- Speak the answer out loud

System design is placed after DSA to reuse analytical momentum,
but kept time-boxed to avoid mental exhaustion.

The goal is **structure and articulation**, not deep optimization.

---

## 🏋️ Physical Training & Reset

**10:30 – 12:00**

- Commute + workout (≈90 minutes total)

Training is intentionally placed here:

- It prevents late-night workouts
- It acts as a full mental reset
- It supports long-term energy and discipline

No performance pressure. Consistency matters more than intensity.

---

## 🍽 Lunch

**12:00 – 12:30**

- Eat
- Cool down
- No screens if possible

---

## 💼 Work — Online Availability Block

**12:30 – 20:30**

- Be online and responsive
- Execute work tasks
- No studying or interview prep

This block aligns with Uzbekistan working hours
and removes background anxiety about missing messages.

Work is treated as a **contained responsibility**, not something that leaks into the whole day.

---

## 🇰🇷 Evening — Korean Activation

**20:30 – 21:30**

- Speaking, listening, or light review
- Follow `checklists/korean.md`

Korean is placed here because:

- It benefits from repetition, not peak focus
- It does not compete with analytical work
- It can be done calmly, even when tired

---

## 🌙 Sleep

**22:00**

Early sleep is not optional.
It exists to protect the 04:30 wake-up and the quality of the next day.
