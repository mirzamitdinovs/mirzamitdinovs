# Phase 2 (Apr → Jun) — Transition & Intensification

This folder contains everything needed to execute **Phase 2** with minimal decision fatigue:

- weekly milestones
- topic checklists (DSA + Korean + System Design)
- reusable templates (weekday with gym / no gym / weekend / fallback)
- weekly reports (filled copies)

Phase 2 builds on Phase 1 and prepares you for **job applications** without rushing them.

## ✅ Start Here

- `phase-2.md` — Phase goals, weekly milestones, success criteria, and rules

## 📌 Checklists (What to study each week)

Located in `checklists/`:

- `checklists/korean.md` — Korean B2 recall & speaking activation

Use these files to decide **what to study**, not how long to study.

## 🔁 Execution Rules

- Do not edit templates; copy them when needed
- Follow weekly topics from `checklists/` to avoid daily planning
- Medium DSA > hard DSA
- System design = structure first, optimization later
- Speaking Korean > studying Korean
- On bad days, use `templates/fallback-day.md` and protect sleep
- Phase 2 is about **readiness**, not urgency
