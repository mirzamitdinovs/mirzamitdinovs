# Phase 4 (Oct → Dec) — Stability & Consolidation

This folder contains everything needed to execute **Phase 4** with minimal decision fatigue:

- a clear stability-focused strategy
- lightweight checklists (job / search / health)
- reusable templates (weekday / weekend / fallback)
- weekly reports (filled copies)

Phase 4 exists to **stabilize your life direction** after the intensity of interviews  
— regardless of whether a job is already secured.

This phase protects:

- mental health
- work performance
- long-term consistency

## ✅ Start Here

- `phase-4.md` — Phase goals, weekly strategy, modes, success criteria, and rules

Read this file before touching any checklist or template.

## 🎯 Phase 4 Objectives

By the end of Phase 4, the following should be true:

- Daily routine feels calm and sustainable
- Work or job search is structured, not stressful
- Physical health and sleep are stable
- Long-term direction is clear (career, family, visa)
- No burnout accumulated from earlier phases

Phase 4 prioritizes **continuity**, not acceleration.

---

## 🧭 Two Operating Modes

Phase 4 runs in **one of two modes**, depending on reality.

### 🟢 Mode A — Job Secured

Use this mode if:

- You have accepted an offer, or
- You are already working in a new role

**Focus:**

- Onboarding and performance
- Establishing healthy work boundaries
- Long-term routine stabilization

---

### 🟡 Mode B — Job Search Maintenance

Use this mode if:

- No offer yet by October, or
- Interviews are slow or paused

**Focus:**

- Selective applications
- Light interview readiness
- Mental recovery and clarity

This is not a restart of Phase 2 or 3.

---

## 🧭 How Phase 4 Is Run

### 1. Choose Mode Once

- Decide **Mode A or Mode B** at the start of the phase
- Do not switch modes impulsively
- Re-evaluate mode monthly, not weekly

---

### 2. Daily Execution

- Use the correct weekday template based on mode
- Weekends are always recovery-focused
- Templates reduce decision-making

---

### 3. Weekly Review

- Every Sunday:
  1. Copy `templates/weekly-review.md`
  2. Paste into `reports/`
  3. Rename to `week-XX-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  4. Fill it calmly (15–20 minutes)

Weekly reviews protect stability, not ambition.

---

## 🔁 Phase 4 Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. No major new goals or projects
2. No restarting aggressive interview prep
3. Health and sleep are mandatory
4. Work consistency > extra effort
5. Gym is maintenance, not performance
6. On bad days, use `templates/fallback-day.md`

---

## 🚦 Exit Criteria (When Phase 4 Ends)

Phase 4 ends successfully if:

- You enter the next year without burnout
- Routine feels automatic, not forced
- Career direction is stable or clearly defined

Phase 4 does not aim to “win” —  
it aims to **carry momentum safely into the next year**.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy of Phase 4

Phase 4 is about **protecting what you built**.

Ambition already did its job.
Now consistency keeps the results.

Calm > urgency  
Stability > acceleration  
Long-term thinking wins
