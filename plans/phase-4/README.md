# Phase 4 (Oct → Dec) — Stability & Consolidation

This folder contains everything needed to execute **Phase 4** with minimal decision fatigue:

- a clear stability-focused strategy
- lightweight checklists (job / search / health)
- reusable templates (weekday / weekend / fallback)
- weekly reports (filled copies)

Phase 4 exists to **stabilize your life direction** after the intensity of interviews  
— regardless of whether a job is already secured.

This phase protects:

- mental health
- work performance
- long-term consistency

## 🎯 Phase 4 Objectives

By the end of Phase 4, the following should be true:

- Daily routine feels calm and sustainable
- Work or job search is structured, not stressful
- Physical health and sleep are stable
- Long-term direction is clear (career, family, visa)
- No burnout accumulated from earlier phases

Phase 4 prioritizes **continuity**, not acceleration.

## 🧭 Two Operating Modes

Phase 4 runs in **one of two modes**, depending on reality.

### 🟢 Mode A — Job Secured

Use this mode if:

- You have accepted an offer, or
- You are already working in a new role

**Focus:**

- Onboarding and performance
- Establishing healthy work boundaries
- Long-term routine stabilization

---

### 🟡 Mode B — Job Search Maintenance

Use this mode if:

- No offer yet by October, or
- Interviews are slow or paused

**Focus:**

- Selective applications
- Light interview readiness
- Mental recovery and clarity

This is not a restart of Phase 2 or 3.
