# Phase 4 (Oct → Dec) — Stability & Consolidation

**Purpose:** Protect what you built in Phases 1–3 and enter the next year without burnout.  
**Theme:** Calm execution, stable routine, clear direction.

Phase 4 is not a “push harder” phase.  
It is a **stability phase** designed for two possible realities:

- **Mode A:** You have a job (or offer accepted)
- **Mode B:** You are still searching (but without panic)

This file defines:

- what Phase 4 is about
- how to choose a mode
- weekly rhythm and milestones
- rules that prevent burnout and chaos

## ✅ Phase 4 Success Criteria (By Dec 31)

Phase 4 is successful if most of the following are true:

- [ ] Daily routine feels sustainable (not forced)
- [ ] Sleep is stable most weeks
- [ ] Gym/health routine is maintained (maintenance, not performance)
- [ ] Work performance is steady (Mode A) OR job search is controlled (Mode B)
- [ ] You do not fall into panic prep / panic applications
- [ ] You enter the next year with clarity and energy

Phase 4 prioritizes **continuity**.

## 🧭 Choose Your Mode (Pick One and Stick With It)

### 🟢 Mode A — Job Secured

Use Mode A if:

- You accepted an offer, or
- You are already working in a new role

**Primary focus:** onboarding + performance + boundaries  
**Secondary focus:** health + routine + stability

### 🟡 Mode B — Job Search Maintenance

Use Mode B if:

- No offer yet by October, or
- Pipeline is slow/paused

**Primary focus:** controlled applications + light readiness  
**Secondary focus:** health + routine + mental recovery

**Important:** Mode B is not “restart Phase 2 or 3.”

---

## 🔁 Weekly Rhythm (Both Modes)

Every week follows this:

1. **Mon–Fri:** execute using the correct weekday template (Mode A or Mode B)
2. **Weekend:** recovery + light structure (no catch-up punishment)
3. **Sunday evening:** weekly review + reset

If a week becomes chaotic, a rule was violated.

## 🗓 Monthly Milestones (High-Level)

## 🚨 Phase 4 Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. No major new commitments or projects
2. No aggressive interview grind
3. No panic applications
4. Health + sleep are mandatory
5. Gym is maintenance, not performance
6. Use fallback days when needed (protect the system)

## 🧠 Philosophy

Phase 4 protects momentum.

Calm > urgency  
Stability > acceleration  
Consistency wins
