# Phase 3 — Applications Checklist

**Purpose:** Generate interviews without burnout  
**Rule:** Weekly batches, not daily anxiety

Applications are operational work, not emotional work.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This checklist is successful if:

- Applications feel controlled, not stressful
- Interviews begin appearing
- You stop applying when interviews dominate

---

## 🗓 Weekly Application Rhythm

Applications are done **once or twice per week**, never daily.

Recommended rhythm:

- One focused application session
- Optional second session if energy is high

---

## ✅ Weekly Checklist

- [ ] 5–10 quality applications submitted
- [ ] Referrals requested where possible
- [ ] Application tracker updated
- [ ] Follow-ups sent (7–10 days after)

---

## 🧾 Resume & Profile Rules

- Resume tailored once per role type
- No daily resume editing
- LinkedIn kept stable (no constant tweaks)

---

## 🚫 Forbidden in Phase 3

- Panic applying to dozens of roles
- Applying when exhausted or emotional
- Rewriting resume every week
- Comparing timelines with others

---

## 🧠 Reminder

Applications are a **pipeline**, not a judgment.

Your job is to:

- feed the pipeline
- keep it healthy
- perform when interviews come

Calm execution beats volume.
