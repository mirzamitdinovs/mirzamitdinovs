# Phase 3 — System Design Checklist (Interview Delivery)

**Purpose:** Deliver clear, structured system design answers  
**Rule:** Structure first, tradeoffs second

System design in Phase 3 is about **communication**, not architecture mastery.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This checklist is successful if:

- You follow the same structure every time
- You do not freeze at open-ended questions
- Interviewers can follow your thinking
- Tradeoffs are stated calmly

---

## 🧱 Mandatory Structure (Always Follow)

Every system design answer must include:

1. Clarify requirements
2. Define constraints & scale
3. High-level architecture
4. Data model
5. API design
6. Scaling strategy
7. Bottlenecks & tradeoffs

Never skip steps.

## 🗂 Core Systems to Repeat

These systems are rotated weekly:

- URL Shortener
- Rate Limiter
- Notification System
- Chat System
- Feed / Timeline
- File Storage

Depth comes from repetition, not variety.

---

## ✅ Weekly Checklist

- [ ] Practiced at least 2 system designs
- [ ] Followed the full structure without skipping
- [ ] Spoke answers out loud
- [ ] Identified at least one tradeoff per system

---

## 🚫 Forbidden in Phase 3

- Deep dives into implementation details
- Learning new distributed systems theory
- Over-optimizing early in the answer
- Silent thinking for long periods

---

## 🧠 Reminder

System design interviews test:

- clarity
- communication
- reasoning

They do NOT test whether you know every technology.

Structure creates confidence.
