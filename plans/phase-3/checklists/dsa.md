# Phase 3 — DSA Checklist (Interview Performance)

**Purpose:** Perform reliably in interviews under pressure  
**Rule:** Repetition > novelty

Phase 3 DSA is NOT about learning.
It is about **execution, clarity, and calm**.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

This checklist is successful if:

- Medium problems feel familiar
- You rarely get stuck on problem framing
- Mistakes are recognized early
- You can explain solutions clearly under time pressure

Speed comes last. Reliability comes first.

---

## 🟦 Core Focus Areas (Always Active)

These topics are revisited **continuously**, not linearly:

- Arrays & Strings
- Hash Maps / Sets
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Binary Search
- Trees (DFS / BFS)
- Recursion patterns

No new categories are introduced in Phase 3.

---

## 🗓 Weekly Usage Pattern

Each week:

- Pick **2–3 core topics** only
- Solve **previously seen patterns**
- Re-solve failed or slow problems
- Do NOT chase new hard problems

---

## ✅ Weekly Checklist

- [ ] Re-solved at least 5 previously attempted problems
- [ ] Practiced explaining solutions out loud
- [ ] At least one timed or mock-style session
- [ ] Mistakes documented (conceptual, not emotional)

---

## 🚫 Forbidden in Phase 3

- Learning brand-new DSA topics
- Grinding large volumes of problems
- Switching resources mid-week
- Measuring progress by problem count

---

## 🧠 Reminder

Interviews test **clarity and composure**, not brilliance.

If a problem feels unfamiliar:

- slow down
- restate the problem
- apply known patterns

Calm execution wins.
