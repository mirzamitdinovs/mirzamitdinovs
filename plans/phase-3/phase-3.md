# Phase 3 — Weekly Strategy & Milestones (Jul → Sep)

Phase 3 is about **execution, repetition, and conversion**.

This file defines:

- what each week is for
- how priorities shift
- how to avoid panic, over-preparation, and burnout

This file is **directional**, not tactical.  
Daily execution lives in templates.  
Topics live in checklists.

## 🎯 Phase 3 Success Criteria

Phase 3 is considered **successful** if **any one** of the following happens:

- A strong job offer is received
- Multiple late-stage interviews are active
- Clear interview gaps are identified and confidence remains intact

Offers are a result — **not the only signal of success**.

## 🧭 Phase Structure Overview

Phase 3 is divided into **three operational modes**, not rigid months.

### Mode 1 — Application Activation

### Mode 2 — Interview Execution

### Mode 3 — Final Rounds & Stabilization

Weeks may overlap between modes depending on reality.

---

## 🟦 Mode 1 — Application Activation (Weeks 1–3)

**Primary Goal:** Start interviews without over-applying  
**Secondary Goal:** Keep interview skills warm

### Weekly Focus

- Applications (structured, limited)
- Resume and profile stability
- Light interview repetition

### What a good week looks like

- 5–10 quality applications sent
- Referrals requested where possible
- DSA and system design reviewed, not expanded

### Rules

- No daily applying
- No resume rewrites mid-week
- Stop applying once callbacks start

---

## 🟨 Mode 2 — Interview Execution (Weeks 4–8)

**Primary Goal:** Perform calmly and consistently in interviews  
**Secondary Goal:** Protect work and sleep

### Weekly Focus

- Interview preparation tied to scheduled interviews
- Mock-style repetition
- System design verbal practice

### What a good week looks like

- Interviews feel familiar, not novel
- Mistakes are tracked without emotional reaction
- Preparation is focused, not scattered

### Rules

- Interviews override application work
- No new major topics
- Use interview-day templates strictly

---

## 🟥 Mode 3 — Final Rounds & Stabilization (Weeks 9–12)

**Primary Goal:** Close loops and avoid self-sabotage  
**Secondary Goal:** Maintain health and clarity

### Weekly Focus

- Final-round preparation
- Offer comparison or expectation management
- Calm repetition only

### What a good week looks like

- Preparation is targeted and calm
- No panic studying
- Energy remains stable

### Rules

- No additional applications unless pipeline collapses
- Reduce prep volume, increase rest
- Do not renegotiate life structure mid-phase

---

## 🔁 Weekly Rhythm (All Modes)

Every week follows this logic:

1. **Monday:** Execute weekly focus (from this file)
2. **Mid-week:** Adjust only if interviews force it
3. **Sunday:** Weekly review and reset

No week should feel chaotic.
If it does, the system is being violated.

---

## 🚨 Phase 3 Guardrails

These rules protect the phase:

- No panic applications
- No learning-from-zero
- No resource hopping
- No sacrificing sleep for prep
- No comparing timelines with others

If energy drops:
→ reduce scope  
→ keep structure  
→ continue calmly

## 🧠 Phase 3 Mindset

Phase 3 is not a sprint.
It is controlled exposure to uncertainty.

You already did the preparation.
This phase exists to **let it work**.

Consistency > intensity  
Structure > motivation  
Calm execution wins
