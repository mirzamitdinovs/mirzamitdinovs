# Phase 3 (Jul → Sep) — Applications & Interviews

This folder contains everything needed to execute **Phase 3** with minimal decision fatigue:

- weekly strategy and milestones
- topic checklists (DSA + System Design + Applications)
- reusable templates (weekday / interview day / weekend / fallback)
- weekly reports (filled copies)

Phase 3 exists to **convert readiness into interviews and offers**  
without panic, burnout, or over-preparation.

## ✅ Start Here

- `phase-3.md` — Phase goals, weekly strategy, success criteria, and rules

Read this file before touching any checklist or template.

---

## 🎯 Phase 3 Objectives

By the end of Phase 3, the following should be true:

- Job applications are sent consistently and calmly
- Interviews are happening (screens, technical, or system design)
- DSA performance is reliable under interview pressure
- System design answers follow a fixed structure
- Work performance and sleep remain protected

Phase 3 is **execution**, not learning from zero.

## 🧭 How Phase 3 Is Run

### 1. Weekly Strategy

- Follow `phase-3.md` to understand **what the week is for**
- Some weeks prioritize applications
- Some weeks prioritize interviews
- Do not mix priorities mid-week

---

### 2. Daily Execution

- Choose the correct template:
  - `weekday-template.md` → normal work + prep days
  - `interview-day-template.md` → days with interviews
  - `weekend-template.md` → Saturday & Sunday
- Do not improvise daily schedules

---

### 3. Topic Guidance

- Use files in `checklists/` to decide **what to work on**
- No new resources allowed unless explicitly added to checklist
- Repetition > novelty

---

### 4. Weekly Review

- Every Sunday:
  1. Copy `templates/weekly-review.md`
  2. Paste into `reports/`
  3. Rename to `week-XX-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  4. Fill it honestly (15–20 minutes)

Weekly reviews are used to:

- detect overload early
- reduce scope if needed
- maintain consistency

---

## 🔁 Execution Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Applications are done **weekly**, not daily
2. Interviews override preparation when scheduled
3. No learning new major topics
4. DSA = repetition and performance
5. System design = structure and clarity
6. Work and sleep must not collapse
7. On bad days, use `templates/fallback-day.md`

---

## 🚦 Exit Criteria (When Phase 3 Ends)

Phase 3 is considered successful if **any one** of the following is true:

- A strong job offer is received
- Multiple final-round interviews are active
- You clearly identify remaining gaps and can re-enter focused preparation

Phase 3 does **not** require perfection to end.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy of Phase 3

Phase 3 is about **calm execution under uncertainty**.

You already did the hard work in Phase 1 and Phase 2.  
Now the system exists to prevent panic, overthinking, and burnout.

Consistency > intensity  
Structure > motivation  
Execution beats anxiety
